Steps to create a AOP Project

Step 1:
    Add Aspect J specific dependencies
    1) Aspect JRT (Runtime)
    2) Aspect Weaver

Step 2:
    - Create Bean Specific Class (Musician , Singer)

Step 3:
    - Create Aspect Specific class (Audience)
    - Once the class is created, it must be registered as Aspect Specific Class
    - This is done by using @Aspect annotation provided by Aspect J library

    - Once the class define the relevant methods for handling secondary concern, it is necessary to configure this method for relevant type of advice
     -Aspect J library provide several annotation to accomplish this
     Eg:   1. @Before
           2. @AfterReturning
           3. @AfterThrowing
           4. @After
           5. @Around

     - All these annotation are to be applied to a method level
     - Once these advice specific annotation is applied, it is necessary to indicate where to the aspect is plugged in. This is done by using pointCut
     - To apply the pointCut there are 2 option:
        1. Use a pointCut expression as a parameter for the advice specific annotation parameter.
            - This approach is used if different expression are used for different advices

        2. Declare the pointCut expression only once and use it multiple time
            - This approach is used if same expression is to be used for different advices

            - To achieve this, it is necessary to define some method for forward referencing and configure that method as a pointcut by applying @PointCut annotation
            - In order to specify the PointCut, the annotation accepts a String that indicates PointCut Expression
            - It is mainly used with designators
            - The most commonly used designation is 'execution'

Step 4:
    - Create Configuration specific class.
    - Since the configuration is done for AOP and in AOP weaving comes into the picture by generating a PROXY, it has to be enabled
    - This is done by using @EnableAspectJAutoProxy annotation which is to be applied on class level on configuration specific class

Step 5:
    - Write Main Program (Client Program)
