Step to create Spring Boot Project
Step 1:
    - Open Web Browser adn access the URL: start.spring.io

Step 2:
    - Provide the Project Specific Configuration metaData
    Eg.
        Project Type: Maven/Gradle with Groovy/ Gradle with Kotlin etx
        Version: *** Avoid Snapshot versions
        Add dependencies: Web and Devtools
        In case of Maven, maven specific metadata eg. groupId, articfactId and so on

Step 3:
    - Click 'Generate' to download the Maven project specific Zip file

Step 4:
    - Unzip the file and import on workspace

Step 5:
    - Change the port number.
    - The embedded tomcat server given by spring boot by default gets launch on port  8080.
    - Since 8080 is very common code it is advisable to change it
    - To configure Spring Boot project eg. Changing the port number there is one properties file. It is located under 'src/main/resources'.


Step 6:
    - Create REST API End Point
    Eg: HTTP GET for URL: /show-greeting

    - To create any end-point in specific for REST, it is necessary to define a class which will be used for handling REST resources.

    - Once the class is created, it is to be registered in such a way that it will be capable of handling REST resources.This is possible using an annotation called as @RestController
    - It is applied at class level

    - To create a endpoint it is necessary to define method and annotate that using '@RequestMapping' annotation
