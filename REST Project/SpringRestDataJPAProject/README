Step to for Spring Data JPA example
Spring Data JPA Example:
Step 1:
			Access Spring Initializer (start.spring.io) to build a Maven project with following dependencies.
				1. Spring Web
				2. Devtools
				3. Spring Data JPA
				4. MySQL Driver
				
Step 2:
			Configure the project by making entries in application.properties
			E.g.
				Server Port
				Driver Class
				URL
				Username
				Password
				etc.


Step 3:
	Create necessary artifacts (Class,Interfaces and so on)
	1. JPA Entity Class:Movie
	2. Repository Interface: Repository_name(Movie Repository)
	3. Service Class: MovieService
	4. Controller Class: MovieController
	
	
Step 4:
	- Handle Scanning
	- Once all the artifacts (Classes and Interface) have been created, spring REST environment needs to pick them up. This is done using Scanning.
	
	- In Spring Data JPA, Scanning is done for 3 things:
		1. Scanning of Controller and Service (Eg. MovieConroller and MovieService):
			- This is done using a regular annotation: @SpringBootApplication as it is a superset of @ComponentScan
		
		2. Scanning of JPA specific repository (Eg. MovieRepository):
			- This is done using an annotation @EnableJpaRepositories
			
		3. Scanning of JPA specific entity (Eg. Movie)
			- This is done using an annotation : @EntityScan
